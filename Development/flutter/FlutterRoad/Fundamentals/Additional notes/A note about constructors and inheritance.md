In object-oriented programming, when you create a subclass (like the `Student` class) that extends a superclass (like the `Person` class), the subclass inherits properties and methods from the superclass. However, when it comes to initializing those properties through the constructor, they are not automatically inherited. Let me explain why:

1. **Constructor Inheritance:**
In Dart, constructors are not inherited by subclasses. When you create a subclass, you need to define its constructors explicitly. If you don't provide any constructors in the subclass, Dart automatically adds a default constructor that calls the superclass's no-argument constructor (if available). However, if the superclass only has a parameterized constructor (a constructor with arguments), Dart does not add a default constructor to the subclass.

2. **Superclass Constructor and Initialization:**
In the `Person` class, you defined a parameterized constructor `Person(this.name, this.age)`, which requires `name` and `age` as arguments to create a `Person` object. Since the `Student` class extends `Person`, it needs to ensure that `Person` is properly initialized when a `Student` object is created.

3. **Subclass Constructor:**
In the `Student` class, you defined a constructor `Student(String name, int age, this.school) : super(name, age)`. This is the constructor of the `Student` class. When you create a `Student` object, this constructor is used to initialize the `Student` object. The `super(name, age)` part calls the constructor of the superclass (`Person`) and passes the `name` and `age` arguments to it, ensuring that the `Person` part of the `Student` object is correctly initialized.

4. **Why you cannot omit `name` and `age` in `Student` constructor:**
When creating a `Student` object, you need to provide values for both `name` and `age` since the `Student` constructor requires them (`Student(String name, int age, this.school)`). Even though `Student` extends `Person`, it does not inherit the `Person` constructor automatically. Therefore, you need to explicitly call the `Person` constructor using `super(name, age)` in the `Student` constructor to ensure proper initialization of the superclass part.

Here's an example of creating a `Student` object:

```dart
void main() {
  var student = Student('Alice', 20, 'XYZ University');
  student.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice, I am 20 years old, and I study at XYZ University.
}
```

In summary, properties and methods are inherited by subclasses in Dart, but constructors are not automatically inherited. When creating a subclass, you need to define its constructors explicitly and ensure that the superclass part is correctly initialized using the `super` keyword. This ensures that all necessary data is provided to create both the subclass and the superclass objects properly.
