# Coming from JS
If you're coming from JavaScript, which is not null-safe by default, the concept of "sound null safety" in Dart will bring a significant improvement to your coding experience and the stability of your programs. Here's how it makes a difference:

1. **Preventing Null-Related Errors:** In JavaScript, you might encounter errors like "Cannot read property 'something' of null" when you try to access properties or methods of variables that are null. In Dart with sound null safety, the language's type system helps catch these errors before runtime, making your code more reliable and preventing such crashes.
    
2. **Fewer Runtime Crashes:** In JavaScript, if you accidentally use a variable that is null, it often leads to runtime crashes or unexpected behavior. Dart's null safety helps catch these mistakes before you run your code, reducing the chances of runtime errors.
    
3. **Clearer Intent:** With Dart's null safety, you're required to be explicit about whether a variable can be null or not. This leads to more accurate code because you're forced to think about and define nullability upfront, making your intentions clearer to other developers and even to your future self.
    
4. **Enhanced Code Readability:** Dart's null safety features provide clear indications in your code about whether a variable can be null or not. This can improve code readability because it's immediately apparent whether a value needs to be checked for null before using it.
    
5. **Improved Maintenance:** Sound null safety can help prevent subtle bugs related to null values that might not be immediately obvious in large codebases. This can make maintaining and debugging your code easier over time.
    
6. **Refactoring Confidence:** When you refactor or make changes to your code, you can have more confidence that you're not introducing null-related issues, as the null safety system will flag potential problems during the development process.
