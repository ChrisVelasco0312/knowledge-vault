I want to list some points, some toughts, about certain things that doesn't let me improve my english. And i write this text as a starting point of my learning to write and speak journey.

I've never study english formally. In the school we have 2 hours of english every day, but i feel i didn't learn anything. I learn the english from the video games, from movies, from youtube vloggers, and a variety of random sources. So i have notions, but also, my english is broken, because that grammatical structures are there by themselfs, it appears from those random sources, and emerges from my head unconsciously.

I feel like i miss a ton of words to express myself. Hopefully in my challenging journey i find those words i need.

### Review 01

Here's one possible way to revise and improve your first paragraph:

"I'd like to share some thoughts about the challenges I face in improving my English skills. This text marks the beginning of my journey towards better writing and speaking abilities, and I hope to identify and address the specific obstacles that have hindered my progress thus far."

Here are some specific suggestions for improvement:

-   "List" can be a bit vague and doesn't necessarily convey the purpose or context of the points you want to make. "Share some thoughts" is more direct and specific.
-   "Certain things" is also quite vague. If possible, try to be more specific about the particular aspects of English that you struggle with.
-   "Doesn't let me" is grammatically incorrect. You could instead say "prevent me from" or "hinder my ability to".
-   "Starting point of my learning to write and speak journey" is a bit wordy and unclear. I rephrased it to make it clearer that this text marks the beginning of your effort to improve your skills.
-   Finally, I added a sentence that sets up the purpose and goals of your text, which can help guide your writing and make it more focused.

Here's one possible way to revise and improve your second paragraph:

"I struggle with expressing my thoughts when speaking or writing in English. My mind often goes blank, and I have difficulty finding the right words. However, I am able to read a wide range of technical books with ease. While I may still struggle with poetry and literary works, I recognize that they offer opportunities to expand my vocabulary. I apologize if my writing seems vague or disjointed; the purpose of this text is to serve as a starting point for improving my English language skills, including my ability to articulate my thoughts, expand my vocabulary, and improve my grammar."

Here are some specific suggestions for improvement:

-   "Serious problem" might be a bit too strong of a phrase to describe your difficulty with expressing yourself in English. "I struggle with" might be a more accurate and less alarming way to convey your challenges.
-   "My toughts" should be "my thoughts."
-   "The words just leave my head" is a bit unclear. It might be helpful to rephrase this to explain that you have difficulty finding the right words to express your thoughts.
-   "Literacy" is not the right word here. It might be better to say "literary works."
-   "Enrich my box of words" might be interpreted as a bit casual or slangy. It's okay to use idiomatic expressions, but it's important to be mindful of the tone and register of your writing depending on the context.
-   "Sorry if i sound a little bit vague" is fine, but it might be better to take ownership of your writing and acknowledge that you want to improve it. For example, you could say "I recognize that my writing may seem vague or disjointed, but I hope to improve it by working on my English language skills."

Here's one possible way to revise and improve your third paragraph:

"I've never studied English formally. Although I had two hours of English classes in school each day, I didn't feel like I learned much. Instead, I've learned English through a variety of sources, such as video games, movies, and YouTube vloggers. While this has given me a basic understanding of the language, my English can be broken and lacks a strong grammatical foundation. The structures I use often come from these random sources and emerge unconsciously, making it difficult for me to express myself accurately and fluently."

Here are some specific suggestions for improvement:

-   "I didn't learn anything" might be a bit too strong of a statement. It's possible that you did learn some things, but perhaps not as much as you would have liked.
-   It's important to capitalize "English" when referring to the language.
-   "Notions" might be a bit vague. You could be more specific about what aspects of English you feel comfortable with and what areas you struggle with.
-   "Broken" is a bit informal. You might consider using "fragmented" or "ungrammatical" instead.
-   "That grammatical structures are there by themselfs" is a bit unclear. It might be helpful to rephrase this to explain that the structures you use are often based on what you've heard or seen in various sources, rather than a deliberate choice.
-   Finally, I added a sentence that explains how this lack of grammatical foundation has affected your ability to express yourself accurately and fluently, which helps to tie your paragraph together and add more detail to your story.

Your fourth sentence is concise and clear, but you might consider expanding it a bit to provide more detail and to tie it more closely to the rest of your text. Here's one possible revision:

"I often struggle to find the right words to express myself fully and accurately in English. However, I am determined to continue my learning journey and acquire the vocabulary I need to communicate effectively. With hard work and dedication, I believe that I can overcome this challenge and achieve my goals."

In this revision, I added a sentence to explain your determination to continue learning and improving your English, as well as a sentence that speaks to the potential for growth and success despite the challenges you face.

### Tought 02

I've been thinking this days, about the cultural barrier of language that we as Colombians experience when we are learning English. We live in a third world country, this means, we have such inequality in our society and some groups have more privileges than others.

I'm from a middle class family, the "worker class". I remember not having a lot of things, and having friends that have a lot of things i want, we study in the same school, but we have such a different life styles. I have access to internet, movies, a computer and tv cable, this allows me in the time, to learn english from different sources. Although we have two hours of english each day, some of my classmates have parents with the possibility to pay for extra courses, because the normal english classes in the school weren't enough for us to learn all we need. 

I was one of those who can't afford the extra courses, because it was expensive for my parents, so i have to learn passively. The result is my english writing and speaking abilities are limited, and i have to struggle with fear of been judged, because those who can afford english, also have the confidence.

Maybe all this are in my head, and i have to focus on my own journey, my own process, and stop to pay attention to those mental imaginative barriers. 

### Review 02

Thank you for sharing your writing with me. Here are a few suggestions for how you can improve it:

1.  Use correct capitalization: Capitalize the first letter of the first word of each sentence, as well as the first letter of proper nouns (like Colombia).
2.  Use appropriate punctuation: Use commas to separate clauses or ideas in a sentence. You can also use a colon to introduce a list, as in "We live in a third world country: this means we have such inequality in our society."
3.  Clarify your meaning: When you say "cultural barrier of language," it's not entirely clear what you mean. Do you mean that there are cultural differences that make it difficult to learn English, or that the language barrier itself is a cultural issue? Try to be more specific about what you mean.
4.  Be careful with your tenses: You start in the present tense ("I've been thinking"), but then switch to the past tense ("we as Colombians experience"). Try to keep your tenses consistent throughout the piece.
5.  Provide more detail: It would be helpful to your readers if you provided more information about the specific challenges that Colombians face when learning English, as well as how these challenges are related to inequality in society.
6.  Consider your audience: Think about who your intended audience is and what their level of knowledge or familiarity with the topic might be. Use language that is appropriate for your audience and avoid using jargon or overly technical terms.
7.  Review your writing for clarity: After you have made revisions, take some time to review your writing for clarity. Make sure that your ideas are presented in a logical order and that your sentences are easy to understand.

With these suggestions in mind, here's an example of how you might revise your writing:

"I've been thinking a lot lately about the challenges that Colombians face when learning English. As a third-world country, we experience a great deal of inequality in our society, and this can make it difficult for some groups to access the resources they need to learn English effectively. I believe that this cultural and linguistic divide is a significant barrier that we need to address if we want to improve educational opportunities for all Colombians. In this piece, I will explore some of the specific challenges that Colombians face when learning English and how these challenges are related to broader issues of inequality and social justice."

Thank you for sharing your writing with me. Here are some suggestions to help you improve it:

1.  Use appropriate punctuation: Use commas to separate clauses or ideas in a sentence. For example, you can add a comma after "and having friends" to separate that phrase from the rest of the sentence.
2.  Be careful with your tenses: You start in the present tense ("I'm from a middle class family"), but then switch to the past tense ("I remember not having a lot of things"). Try to keep your tenses consistent throughout the piece.
3.  Clarify your meaning: It's not entirely clear what you mean when you say "the 'worker class.'" Do you mean that your family works in a manual labor job? Try to be more specific about what you mean.
4.  Use specific examples: When you say that you have access to internet, movies, a computer, and TV cable, it would be helpful to your readers if you provided some specific examples of how these resources have helped you learn English.
5.  Be concise: Some of your sentences are quite long and could be broken up into smaller sentences for better clarity and readability.
6.  Check for typos and errors: Make sure to proofread your writing for typos, spelling errors, and grammatical mistakes.

With these suggestions in mind, here's an example of how you might revise your writing:

"I come from a middle-class family that falls into the worker class. Growing up, I remember not having many material possessions, while some of my friends had access to things I could only dream of. Although we had two hours of English each day at school, some of my classmates were able to take extra courses because their parents had the means to pay for them. Fortunately, my family had access to the internet, movies, a computer, and TV cable, which allowed me to supplement my learning from different sources. For example, I was able to watch English movies with subtitles and practice my listening and reading skills. Despite the challenges, I was able to learn English and improve my opportunities in life."

Thank you for sharing your writing with me. Here are some suggestions to help you improve it:

1.  Use appropriate punctuation: Use commas to separate clauses or ideas in a sentence. For example, you can add a comma after "because it was expensive for my parents" to separate that clause from the rest of the sentence.
2.  Be consistent with your verb tense: In your second sentence, you use the present tense ("my English writing and speaking abilities are limited"), but then switch to the past tense ("and I had to struggle") in the following sentence. Try to keep your verb tense consistent throughout the piece.
3.  Provide more detail: It would be helpful to your readers if you provided more information about how you learned English passively. What were some of the resources or methods you used to learn? Did you have any support from friends, family members, or teachers?
4.  Use specific examples: When you say that you have to struggle with the fear of being judged, it would be helpful to your readers if you provided some specific examples of situations where this fear has impacted you.
5.  Use descriptive language: Try to use descriptive language to help your readers understand your experiences more fully. For example, instead of saying "those who can afford English," you could say "those who have the means to pay for English courses."
6.  Be concise: Some of your sentences are quite long and could be broken up into smaller sentences for better clarity and readability.
7.  Check for typos and errors: Make sure to proofread your writing for typos, spelling errors, and grammatical mistakes.

With these suggestions in mind, here's an example of how you might revise your writing:

"Growing up, my family couldn't afford to pay for extra English courses, so I had to learn passively. This meant that my English writing and speaking abilities were limited, and I had to struggle with the fear of being judged by others who had the means to pay for courses and were more confident in their abilities. Despite these challenges, I tried to learn from any resource I could find, like reading books and watching English TV shows. However, I still faced the challenge of not having someone to practice speaking with or to give me feedback. This lack of resources and support has had a lasting impact on my confidence in speaking and writing in English."

Great job! Your sentence is clear and concise. Here are some minor suggestions to make it even better:

1.  Use "maybe" or "perhaps" at the beginning of the sentence to show that this is just a possibility or thought.
2.  Consider adding a comma after "process" to separate it from the rest of the sentence.

With these suggestions in mind, here's an example of how you might revise your writing:

"Maybe all of these perceived barriers are just in my head. I need to focus on my own journey, my own process, and stop paying attention to these imaginary mental barriers."
