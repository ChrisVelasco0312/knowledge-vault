There was once a man named Jim who was up to his neck in debt. He owed money on
his car, his house, and his credit cards and was finding it hard to get out of debt, so he
decided to go to a loan shark for help.

The loan shark lent him the money with one condition. If Jim didn’t pay back the loan within
a month, he would owe double the amount.

Confident that he would have the money, Jim agreed to the condition.

A month passed, and the loan shark was calling Jim so he could collect his money, but he
wasn’t able to get a hold of him. It seemed as though Jim was hiding.

Three months had gone by, and all of a sudden, the loan shark received a tip that Jim was
shopping at the mall with his daughter. So, he rushed to the mall and confronted Jim and his
daughter just as they were about to get into the car.

“Jim! Where have you been? I’ve been looking for you!”

“Hey!” Jim responded with a quiver in his voice. “Ya, I’ve been looking for you too. I had your
money, but I couldn’t reach you. I can have it to you by next week.”

“You know, the amount has tripled. Are you really going to have all that money for me in one
week?” The loan shark asked.

“Ya, don’t worry. I’ll have it for you.” Replied Jim.

Knowing that Jim would probably disappear again, the loan shark made him another offer.
“Why don’t I make you another deal,” said the loan shark. “I’m going to pick up two pebbles: a white one and a grey one. I’ll put them both in this bag, and your beautiful daughter can pick out one of the pebbles. If she picks out the white one, I’ll wipe your debt clean and walk away. But if she picks out the grey one, I’ll still clear your debt, but your daughter will have to marry me.”

The daughter was appalled at the request, and even more appalled when she noticed her father was considering taking the offer.

“Deal.” said Jim.

So, the loan shark bent down to pick up the pebbles. Jim’s daughter was paying close attention and noticed the loan shark picked up two grey pebbles and put them in the bag.
“Take your pick, my dear,” said the loan shark.

Now, the daughter had three options. She could have:

a. Refused to pick a pebble.
b. Picked up both pebbles and exposed the loan shark’s scam
c. Picked a pebble from the bag knowing that she would have to marry the ugly loan shark

But Jim’s daughter was a smart cookie, and she quickly evaluated each option and its
repercussions. She knew she needed to think outside the box. So, she reached into the bag
and picked up a pebble, but before showing anyone, she ‘accidentally’ dropped it on the floor with all the other pebbles.

“Oops!! I dropped the pebble. But don’t worry, just look into the bag for the pebble that’s left, and you’ll be able to tell which color pebble I picked.”

When the father looked into the bag, he saw a grey pebble and let out a sigh of relief that his
loan would be cleared, and he wouldn’t have to marry off his daughter.

The loan shark stayed quiet as he didn’t want to expose his cheating ways and was forced to
clear Jim’s debt.
