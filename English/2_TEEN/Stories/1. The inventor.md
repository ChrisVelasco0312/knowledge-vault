Tom was an American inventor who grew up in Michigan together with his six siblings.
He was homeschooled by his mother and read many books on Science and Art.
Regardless of Tom’s hearing problems, he was a bright boy who loved to experiment and learn new things. He began his career as an inventor at the age of thirty by creating a device that could record sounds and play them back. This invention was revolutionary at that time and essentially made Tom a celebrity. Everyone was calling him a genius.

This attention inspired Tom to continue experimenting with transmitters until one day he
stumbled upon a system of electric illumination. During the 1800’s, people lit up their homes with gas and oil-based lamps. The problem was that these methods were expensive and dangerous. Many houses burned down after oil lamps were accidentally dropped and draperies caught on fire. Tom saw a problem that most people didn’t even realize they had, and he wanted to find a solution.

So, he hired a team of experts to assist him in a new project that would change the world.
As with most major achievements, there were many failures along the way. And after some
time, the people around him started to doubt the project and tried to encourage him to stop
his efforts and work on something else. But this never discouraged Tom.

He understood that if he was going to invent something extraordinary, it wouldn’t be easy, he would have to fail, and it would be through those difficult moments that would make him stronger and give him the experience he needed to succeed. After years of trial and error, Thomas A. Edison changed the world by inventing the lightbulb.
