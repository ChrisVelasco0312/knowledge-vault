#### **1. Talk about a person in your life that has inspired you.**

- **Person:** My mother
- **Description:** She is a hardworking person that emerge from the bottom while she was looking after us when we were child (I have 1 brother btw and I'm the oldest.
- **Inspiration:** She influenced me to follow and work hard to achieve my dreams. When I was a child, our economic situation was really hard, she was unemployed and we struggle to pay the bills, however she sacrificed a lot, even time with us to work hard, and to give us, me and my brother all we need to study and became graduates from our careers. She also taught me to read a lot very early, so I know how to work hard and being independent, and I'm also a good reader. I read for fun and I enjoy so much to study.


#### **2. If you were president, what would you change, why would you change them, and how would you do it?**


This one is really hard, because I got really stressed by politics and it is even worst if is related with my country.

I will say the obvious, that bring education to people in poverty is the answer but no, the social reality is really complex. Vulnerable people in marginal contexts, 33% in extreme monetary poverty, that being based on data collected in 2023 by "Departamento Nacional de planeación", you can't just ask them to study when they have big problems trying to even eat and survive. 

So I will try to strengthen the social politics around private sector, to obligate the companies to have programs to employ people in this sectors. Also this sectors have health problems, so we have to improve the administration of healthcare in our country. And last but not least, I have a strong believe that corruption is the rotten root of all our problems, so we will have to be strict with the measures taken against the criminals in our government that are corrupt. That will be exemplary measure with even life sentences.
