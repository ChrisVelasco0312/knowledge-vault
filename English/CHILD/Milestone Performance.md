1. Describe 5 activities that are part of your daily routine.

In my daily routine, I wake up and after brushing my teeth and taking a shower, I get ready for work. As I work from home, I turn on the computer and review my to-do list. At 9:00 am, I attend a daily meeting for my job to report the status of my tasks. After that, I try to complete all the tasks assigned or pending. At 11:30 am, I get ready for the gym and do my workout. There, I start with a brief cardio session of 5 to 10 minutes, then I do the warm-up exercises, and finally I do the daily muscle workout. After that, I have lunch and get back to my job again. In the evening, after resting for 1 to 2 hours after dinner, I study English for 2 hours and programming for 2 hours before finally going to sleep.
