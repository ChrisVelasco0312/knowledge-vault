# 1. Describe 5 activities that are part of your daily routine.

In my daily routine, I wake up and after brushing my teeth and taking a shower, I get ready for work. 

As I work from home, I turn on the computer and review my to-do list. At 9:00 am, I attend a daily meeting for my job to report the status of my tasks. After that, I try to complete all the tasks assigned or pending. 

At 11:30 am, I get ready for the gym and do my workout. There, I start with a brief cardio session of 5 to 10 minutes, then I do the warm-up exercises, and finally I do the daily muscle workout. 

After that, I have lunch and get back to my job again.

In the evening, after resting for 1 to 2 hours after dinner, I study English for 2 hours and programming for 2 hours before finally going to sleep.



## 2. Tell me about your last vacation. Where did you go? Who did you go with? What did you do?

During my last vacation, I went to Bogota with my wife Paula. 

We planned this short trip to the city because we wanted to attend a big festival called Stereo Picnic. This festival lasts 4 days straight and has multiple bands playing.

A great number of these bands were our all-time favorites, as we share the same taste in music. 

We listened to big names like Placebo, Paula's favorite band. Actually, the tickets to the concert were my present for her birthday because I knew how emotional Paula would get with this band. 

Besides that, we also loved the performances of Yves Tumor, James Blake, Arca, and what we considered the best concert of the festival, the Arcade Fire performance almost closing the night on Sunday, the last day of the festival. 

We didn't only enjoy the bands; the whole setting was amazing. It took place in "Parque Simon Bolivar", a huge natural park in Bogot√°, so the festival was also huge and had multiple alternative events to entertain yourself, as well as zones for delicious food and resting places that made the experience comfortable and amazing. 

We ended up very tired but so happy at the same time; it was an unforgettable experience indeed.


## 3. Tell me about your best friend.

My best friend is my wife. I want to say first that for me, it is difficult to keep in contact with my old friends, so I do not have too many friends at this point in my life. That became even worse after the pandemic. 

However, my best friend now is also my wife. As I mentioned, her name is Paula, and we share a lot of activities we enjoy together, and we have the same taste in music. 

We motivate each other to work out, for example, and we are now addicted to the gym. 

We also enjoy movies a lot; she is a huge fan of cinema, and we are deep critics of films. 

We enjoy discussing movies in depth, from the plot to the style or aesthetics. 

That is just the tip of the iceberg of what we are capable of sharing together. That's why we are best friends.
