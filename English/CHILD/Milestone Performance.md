1. Describe 5 activities that are part of your daily routine.

In my daily routine, I wake up and after brushing my teeth and taking a shower, I get ready for work. As I work from home, I turn on the computer and review my to-do list. At 9:00 am, I attend a daily meeting for my job to report the status of my tasks. After that, I try to complete all the tasks assigned or pending. At 11:30 am, I get ready for the gym and do my workout. There, I start with a brief cardio session of 5 to 10 minutes, then I do the warm-up exercises, and finally I do the daily muscle workout. After that, I have lunch and get back to my job again. In the evening, after resting for 1 to 2 hours after dinner, I study English for 2 hours and programming for 2 hours before finally going to sleep.



3. Tell me about your last vacation. Where did you go? Who did you go with? What did you do?

In my last vacation, I did go to Bogota with my wife Paula. We planned this short trip to this city because we wanted to attend a big festival named Stereo Picnic. This festival last 4 days straight, and have multiple bands playing. A great amount of those bands were our favorites of all time as we share the same taste in music, we listened to big names as Placebo the Paula´s favorite band, actually the tickets of the concert was my present for her birthday, because I knew how emotional will Paula´s get with this band. Besides of that, we also loved the performance of Ives Tumor, James Blake, Arca and what we considered the best concert of the festival, the Arcade Fire performance almost closing the night of the sunday and the last day of the festival. We did not only enjoy the bands, all the setting was amazing, it took place in "Parque Simon Bolivar", a huge natural park in Bogotá, so the festival was huge also, and had multiple alternative events to entertain yourself as well zones for delicious food and resting places that makes the experience confortable and amazing. We end up so tired but so happy at the same time, it was an unforgettable experience indeed.
