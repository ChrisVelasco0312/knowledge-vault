Two friendly comrades were walking along a dirt road in search of shelter. They were
both homeless and often wandered the streets together.
On this particular day, one of the men saw something up ahead that looked like a bag. He ran towards it and saw that it was a purse. When he picked it up, he noticed how heavy it was, so he opened it and saw dozens of big shiny gold coins.
“Look what I’ve found! It’s a purse full of gold. How lucky am I?” Said the man.
“Wow! We’re rich!” said the other.
“No no. I found it. I’m rich.” The man quickly responded.
Shocked at his friend’s response, he replied, “You shouldn’t speak in the singular. We are comrades who travel as one. Instead, you should say ‘WE have found a purse and how lucky are WE’ Travelers must share all the fortunes and misfortunes WE may come across together.”
“No way! Finders keepers, losers’ weepers!” Replied the man.
Just then, they heard a loud voice shout “STOP! THIEF!”
When they looked up the road, they saw a group of large, angry men with bats and clubs
running towards them.
“OH NO! If they catch us, we’re dead!” said the man gripping the gold purse tightly in his hands.
“We?? Wait a minute.” Said the other man. “Just a second ago you said the purse was YOURS
because YOU found it and that YOU were keeping it. I wouldn’t feel right getting involved now.” And off he ran. Frozen with fear, the man with the gold, just stood there as the group of men approached. They grabbed him and bounded him to a tree. Stole the purse full of gold and left him there. His comrade never returned, and he remained bound to that tree long enough for him to think about his actions and learn a lesson more valuable than gold.
