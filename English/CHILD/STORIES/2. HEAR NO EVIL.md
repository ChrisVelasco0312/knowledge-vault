Seven straight days raining cats and dogs created some massive puddles in the
Everglades. All the frogs were enjoying themselves by swimming around, teasing the
crocodiles, and hopping from one lily pad to another. They were having a great time.
After a few days without any rain and the hot sun beaming down on the puddles, the water
started to dry up. Some of the waterholes seemed to dry up almost instantly.

The wet wonderland had turned into a desert leaving many frogs trapped in ditches that were too deep for them to jump out of. There was one ditch that had about twenty or more frogs in it. They were all jumping like crazy trying to get out because they knew they would die without any water or shade. The other frogs looked down into the ditch and saw them jumping tirelessly and called down to the poor frogs.

“You won’t be able to get up here; it’s too deep. Don’t tire yourself out.”
Eventually, all the frogs stopped trying to get out of the ditch, except one determined little
frog who just kept jumping and jumping using the other frogs as trampolines. Everyone was telling him to stop. “It’s no use!” they cried.

“We’re all going to die down here. If the sun doesn’t dry us up, the birds will come. Either way, we’re doomed.” This little frog seemed to ignore all the comments and just kept jumping until he eventually made it out! “Wow! How did you do that?” One of the frogs asked. But the little frog didn’t respond.

“Hey, little one! Tell us. How did you make it out of that deep ditch?”

The little frog just sat under a leaf and ignored all the chatter. He didn’t say a word.
After an hour of trying to get a response, the frogs realized something was different about the little frog. – He was deaf.
