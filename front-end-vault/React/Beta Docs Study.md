# THE BETA DOCS NOTES
A compilation of useful notes based on my study of the [React beta docs learn section](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn)


### Getting started with hooks initial notes
Hooks are functions that start with `use` . It is posible to reuse logic writing **custom hooks**, combining existing ones.
Are more restrictive than regular functions. 
Only call hooks at the top level of the components.

## Import and export components.
When we are in the process of splitting our components in different file, we need to export or  import those components.

### The root component file
Our root component is usually the App.js filte. If you use a framework with file-based routing, such as Next.js, the root component will be different for every page.
