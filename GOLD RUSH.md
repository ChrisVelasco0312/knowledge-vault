In 1848, a man by the name of James Marshall found a substantial amount of gold in
a Californian river. The news brought millions of people from all over the world to
California in search of this precious metal.
As you can imagine, the impacts on the environment were consequential. Miners were drilling at an alarming rate causing environmental harm. Entire indigenous societies were attacked and removed from their homes, and the population of San Francisco went from 1,000 to 25,000 in just two years.
Two Californian brothers who decided to sell all their belongings and venture out in seek of
gold were sitting at a riverbank as the sun was setting and, in the distance, they saw what
looked like a thin vein of gold.
Jumping up and down in excitement, they hollered, “We’re rich! We’re rich!”
The next day they went to town and bought all the necessary equipment, set up camp, and
started drilling.
They drilled for weeks and weeks, when all of a sudden, the gold vein disappeared.
They continued to drill but quickly lost their motivation because, without the sight of gold, it
was hard to keep working through those hard and tireless days.
Another week without success, the brothers gave up, sold all their equipment and land rights
to another man and returned home.
The man who bought the land hired an engineer to examine the site. And the engineer told
the man to continue digging in the same area as the brothers were.
After one month of constant drilling, the determined man finally struck a gold mine and
became a multimillionaire.
