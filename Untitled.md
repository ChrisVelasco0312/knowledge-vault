A scientist by the name of Igor was an extraordinary chemist with a Ph.D. who majored
in Biology and Health and had a great passion for helping those in need. He spent
hours in his lab experimenting and trying to find cures for the people of his town.
Often people would line-up outside his laboratory, looking for treatments for anything from
the common cold to chronic diseases. But there was one particular disease that seemed to plague his town. Every day he would encounter new patients with abnormal cell growths that would spread throughout their body, cause tumors and eventually death. It was soon realized that these symptoms were consistent with what we now call Cancer.

Once Igor determined that the patient had Cancer, he knew there was nothing he could do to treat him. It was devastating telling the patients how many days they had left to live. The best he could do was to recommend a healthy diet, rest, and time with family. One morning Igor woke up and decided he would make it his life’s mission, to find the cure for Cancer.

He worked round the clock, experimenting and testing with the help of his assistant. But after
three months, his assistant started to complain about their lack of progress.

“We have been working 20 hours a day for the last three months, tested more than a thousand elements looking for an antidote and we haven’t learned a thing!” Igor replied - “After all this time and effort, I can assure you we have learned a lot, and we are
in a much better position than we were three months ago. We can now eliminate over a thousand components from our experimentation research.”
