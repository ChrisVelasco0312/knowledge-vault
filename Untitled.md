It hadn’t rained in months, and the lands were dry. The flowers were wilted, and the
grass wasn’t its usual bright green. All the plants were in dire need of water, and the
animals were searching high and low for something to drink.
One crow decided to gather up the little energy he had and flew over to a cabin in the woods
hoping to find something. The journey wasn’t long, however, it wasn’t easy. The poor crow had to rest many times on the branches of the trees as he made his way through the woods. When he got to the cabin, he saw a dog bowl down below. But when he approached it, it was
bone dry. He then saw a marble birdbath, but it was only filled with dry leaves and sand.
As the crow was about to leave, he noticed a beautiful, blue, tall, ceramic pitcher on the porch. 
He quietly flew over careful not to be seen or heard by any humans or dogs.

The pitcher was tall and had a narrow neck. So, the crow had to perch itself on the windowsill
to look inside. Sure enough, he found what he had been looking for.
The problem was that the neck of the pitcher was too narrow for his beak to reach the water.
So, he tried pushing over the heavy pitcher. He pushed with all his might, but the tall ceramic
pitcher wouldn’t budge.
The crow thought for a minute and came up with a plan.
He went around and gathered up some small pebbles and dropped them into the pitcher one
at a time. With each pebble, the water gradually rose to the top of the pitcher until he was able
to drink to his heart’s content.
